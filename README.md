# CaveGame2D
My first attempt at game development. The game is written entirely using python's Pygame package.

# Instructions to Run (main)

Install Pygame
```bash
python -m pip install pygame
```

run main.py



# Features
- Randomly generated levels
- Distance-activated enemy AI
- Collision physics that took too long to debug
- A world generator that prints a preview in ASCII, it can be run on its own to preview how levels will look for a specific seed
- Two demos that demonstrate the mechanics of the game (AI tracking, Movement)
